constructive positive feedback.<br>I have just done my first practice session for lesson 2 and as someone has noticed before, the anchor finger practice for 2 mins only repeats the previous lessons A-D changes. In the actual lesson you show the transition from E-A-E-D-A-D. I used this during my practice today and there’s no issue if you do that, but updating your practice video to show the moves used in the lesson would be great.<br>Oh and the last song with the changes on beat 1 and 3 came as a bit of a shock but that wasn’t the issue, laughing at myself trying to keep up is what put me off.......Better luck tomorrow with that one I hope.<br>My fingertip ache is this.........when it hurts, think about Tony Iommi playing with a piece of self made, molten plastic pen top on his missing finger tip. You soon stop moaning then!<br>Take care everybody.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

on lesson 3 practice session and found out it is there, the learning for E-A-E-D-A-D.<br>Then i came to realize Justin thought about everyone from strongest learner to the weakest, i guess.<br>He wants us to practice changing from A-D more. I think that is good, it makes us strong for moving ahead.<br>Again i did something for my practice session which helps me in doing good one minute changes from E-A and E-D.<br>I added two new Item under Practice New Item Tab called <br>"Anchor finger practice from E to A for 2min"<br>"Anchor finger practice from E to D for 2min"<br>I added them on Lesson 2 practice Routine, and it helped me alot, now i can do almost 60 changes in one minute after practicing 4days.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

Enjoying the journey. I’m 62 and decided to take up the guitar during the lockdown. I’m enjoying it (my fingers less so, but it’ll pass). I don’t know why but my fingers hate the C chord - keep practising. <br>I accidentally added the Lesson 2 Practice items to my lesson 1 routine. I’ve deleted them, but now I can’t figure out how to save them, as this page says they’ve been saved. Can you help me there please?</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

This has been a really great experience so far. Having dabbled with the guitar for years but never really getting into it, I find the lessons are helping build a strong foundation and are keeping me interested!</p><p>For the 1 minute cord challenge, I have been buying into the "speed over quality" mantra and am getting into the 80+ changes per minute, but they sound like junk. Should I continue to drive for speed over sound, or try to balance it out and target 30-60 per minute that sound good?</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

I think this is where I’ll probably stay for another week as, although I’ve got the basics down, quick changes,anchor fingers etc, I’m still very clunky on the song stuff. I can do the basic 4 strum down but as soon as I try any different strumming it goes all over the place. The Peter Gunn theme is fun yet frustrating! Can’t wait to get stuck into it this week with a view to stage 3 by next weekend, sore fingers crossed.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

that I should know where to put my fingers without looking at a picture, or I should be able to put my fingers in the right place on the neck without looking at my hand? Because I can easily place my fingers for A, D, and E, but I frequently have to check my hands when I'm switching between chords for chord change or song practice. So far I'm *mostly* able to keep up with the songs you have on the app at this level, but I do find that i can't get through any of them without checking some, or I start getting really bad sounding chords, or even missing the right finger position outright.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Hi Justin - I am struggling. Originally I felt that I was making a lot of progress with my 1 minute chord changes, and I remember going from 12 to 19, etc. Now I've been stuck at around 29 - 31 changes per minute for over a week. I feel that I can't progress until I get closer to 40. I know that you said you could move on to the next lesson when you were at around 30, but being around 30 does not make me fast enough to keep up with many of the songs in the app. I have been trying to do the Chord Beat Exercises in the app, and I'm too fast for the 20 setting, but too slow for the 40 setting, so I feel that I cannot progress to Stage 2 until I can successfully complete this at the 40 setting... anyway... just feeling stuck. Any tips to push past 30 with my 1 minute chord changes other than 'keep practicing'? I've been practicing these once a day!</p><p>The other thing that has been hard for me is posture. I find that my back and right hip really hurt after practicing for just 20 or 30 minutes. I sometimes have to quit just because of the back pain (and I'm a healthy 33 year old!) I know that it's because I'm really hunched over to see what my fingers are doing and I'm not sure how to avoid it. I'm not confident enough yet to be able to change chords without looking.</p><p>Thanks for everything!</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

Id like to give just a bit of feedback.</p><p>In the training videos for 1 minute changes. Especially in the A to E and E to D videos, there is a bit in the middle of the video where you suddenly start giving instruction. "Slide this finger here, move these fingers there, slid this one forward, put these ones down" etc...The issue i have is that im going great, at a pretty quick pace and getting into a rhythm, then suddenly half way through you kick into these instructions. usually they were way off time from what im doing so it messes me up because my brain kicks into listening to your instruction instead of just continuing on with what im doing. Ive unfortunately had to start doing those practices with the timer only and not playing the video. Its sad because i really love playing along with the videos</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

Your description is excellent, especially with how to layer and improve it, but without a tab I get a bit lost.  It says this is in songbook 2 - where is that?  I have the app, but l don't see it laid out in bars - which would help to know which is "beat 1" as you have suggested.

When you say we need to do 30 chord changes, does it mean going from E to A and back to E? Or is changing from E to A considered a full chord change, and going back to E another one? It's kind of a dumb question but I wanted to be certain of when to move on to the next lesson.

Cant thank you enough for everything you do! Love the lessons and the practice assistant. One small issue though. If we delete any routines by mistake in practice assistant. the lesson doesnt allow you to save it again. eg BEGINNER LESSON 2 practice routine saved once and deleted cant save the routine again</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer
